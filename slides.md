## Genetic Algorithms: A Concrete Example Using Checkers
Explain the basics of genetic algorithms using checkers

## What Is A Genetic Algorithm?
* **Mutation**
* **Crossover**
* **Selection**

note:
Based on natural selection/evolution. "Evolves" a solution over time/iterations
* Mutation - Between iterations, tweak traits to see if they perform better/worse
* Crossover - Combine traits from two solutions into a new iteration/candidate
* Selection - Filtering the current list of iterations to only the "best" ones
